	<h1>How to play</h1>
	<p>
		The objective of the game is to walk around a maze in complete darkness, get the 
		treasure and escape safely.
	</p>
	<h3>You</h3>
	<p>
		At the beginning of the game, you mist pick a starting location. The starting 
		location will glow green and your player (identified as ♟) will be placed there.
		Then click on adjacent blocks to start moving. If you successfully manage to move
		to another room, the room you moved to will glow until the end of the game. This 
		indicates the room has been explored. If you hit a wall, the wall you hit will 
		appear as a gray line and your turn will end.
	</p>
	<h3>The Dragon</h3>
	<p>
		Once you get within a 2 room distance from the dragon (including diagonally), the 
		dragon will wake up, and the dragon marker (☠) will light up. Once the dragon is
		awake, he will chase player ate the rate of one room per turn. The dragon can move
		diagonally and fly over walls. If you enter the room the dragon is in, or the 
		dragon catches up with you at the end of the turn, the dragon will attack you.
		Once the dragon attacks you, you will lose a life and you will be able to move 2 
		less rooms per turn. Every time you get attacked, the dragon marker will move to 
		the room where you were attacked. If you get attacked 3 times, the game is over. 
		If you get back to your starting location, the dragon will stop chasing you and 
		get back to the treasure room. Be careful, though, because if the dragon lands on 
		your starting location while you're in it, the game is over.
	</p>
	<h3>The Treasure</h3>
	<p>
		The room where the dragon sleeps is also the room where the treasure is in. Once
		you get the treasure, your turn will end and starting from the next turn, you will 
		only be able to move 4 times per turn. While you are holding the treasure, your 
		player marker will turn yellow and a black treasure marker(♛) will be placed at 
		the treasure room. If you get attacked by the dragon while holding the treasure 
		the game will end instantly. Once you get the treasure, your goal is to move back 
		to your starting location. If you succeed, you win the game!
