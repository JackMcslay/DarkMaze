To play the game, go to http://jackmcslay.github.io/DarkMaze/

This is a game based on the dungeons and dragons electronic board game as shown by spoony
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uboK9KovMnY . As the game didn't really have anything to
do with the tabletop RPG, I just named it Dark Maze instead.

The game is made in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with no images, SVG or canvas elements 
involved.
